Study 1 folder contains:
-----

### Data files

Note: We do not include any of the actual code users were editing due to the potential risk of identifiability.

  * study_1_data_part_[1-11].csv - The processed data files for the study 1 regression model. It is split into 11 pieces because of GitHub's file size limit. The R script has code to combine them and a commented out line to save it all as one file. [Field Descriptions](Study%201/study_1_data_fields.md)
  
  * CodeExampleDescriptions.csv - Our classification of the code from the randomly selected browser sessions. Note that we excluded some sessions since our script that selected the browser sessions failed to display the program being edited/executed. [Field Descriptions](Study%201/CodeExampleDescriptionsFields.md)
  
  * CodeExampleDescriptionsSummaryStats.csv - A couple summary statistics for the four countries.

### Statistics files

  * study_1.r - the R script that computes our statistics for study 1
  
  * study_1_r-output.txt - the output from that R script
  

  
  
Study 2 folder contains:
-----

### Experiment files

  * experiment screenshots folder - screenshots that show what the participants saw as they did the experiment.

### Data files

  * many csv files plus follow_up_questions.txt - this is the data from the second study. [File and Field Descriptions](Study%202/fileAndFieldDescriptions.md) 

  
### Statistics files

  * study 2.r - the R script that computes our statistics for study 2
  
  * study_2_r_output.txt - the output from that R script
